# AI-Pathfinder
Implementing a Q-learning algorithm in a 5x5 grid environment where an agent learns to navigate from start to goal while avoiding obstacles. The project demonstrates how the agent improves its decision-making through exploration and exploitation, with the learned path visualized on the grid.
